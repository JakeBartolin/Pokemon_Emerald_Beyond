# Pok√©mon Emerald Beyond
This is a content pack add on for Pokemon Emerald built using the decompilation project "Pokeemerald". Once complete, it will build a complete Pokemon Emerald Beyond game which will allow the player to travel to various sections of Pokemon Emerald normally inaccessable (Faraway Island, Birth Island, etc), as well as the Sevii Islands, the Kanto, and the Johto regions.
